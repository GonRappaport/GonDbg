Ideas in no particular order:
Non-invasive attach to process
Installer
Time travel debugging
RPC Interface for starting sessions (Provides process list, attach, create and maybe some other "main.c" stuff)
Plugins
Integration with python27.dll and creation of a wrapper for the debugger API for use with python in the command
line or scripts (Will be implemented in a plugin) (Think about support for python3)
Make PDBs work
XP Support

Roadmap for version 1.0:
Python
PDB loading
Plugins
Code beautification
Solution and files reorganization
